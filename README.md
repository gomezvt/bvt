# Burlingtonian: Live Like a Local in VT
This repository manages code for the "Burlingtonian: Live Like a Local in VT" app that is not currently available on the App Store. This was a travel/tourism app supported by the Yelp API that allowed users to find places of interest within the Burlington, VT area and is now rebranded as "Sup? City" (see "sup" GitHub repository)
